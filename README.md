# NetBox MCP Server

This is a simple read-only [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for NetBox.  It enables you to interact with your data in NetBox directly via LLMs that support MCP.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| get_objects | Retrieves NetBox core objects based on their type and filters |
| get_object_by_id | Gets detailed information about a specific NetBox object by its ID |
| get_changelogs | Retrieves change history records (audit trail) based on filters |

> Note: the set of supported object types is explicitly defined and limited to the core NetBox objects for now, and won't work with object types from plugins.

## Usage

1. Create a read-only API token in NetBox with sufficient permissions for the tool to access the data you want to make available via MCP.

2. Install dependencies: `uv add -r requirements.txt`

3. Verify the server can run: `NETBOX_URL=https://netbox.example.com/ NETBOX_TOKEN=<your-api-token> uv run server.py`

3. Add the MCP server configuration to your LLM client.  For example, in Claude Desktop (Mac):

UV
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
        "netbox": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/path/to/netbox-mcp-server",
                "run",
                "server.py"
            ],
            "env": {
                "NETBOX_URL": "https://netbox.example.com/",
                "NETBOX_TOKEN": "<your-api-token>"
            }
        }
}
```

Docker
```json
{
  "mcpServers": { 
    "netbox": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e",
        "NETBOX_URL",
        "-e",
        "NETBOX_TOKEN",
        "mcp/netbox-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NETBOX_URL": "https://netbox.example.com/",
        "NETBOX_TOKEN": "<your-api-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
> On Windows, use full, escaped path to your instance, such as `C:\\Users\\myuser\\.local\\bin\\uv` and `C:\\Users\\myuser\\netbox-mcp-server`. 
> For detailed troubleshooting, consult the [MCP quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

4. Use the tools in your LLM client.  For example:

```text
> Get all devices in the 'Equinix DC14' site
...
> Tell me about my IPAM utilization
...
> What Cisco devices are in my network?
...
> Who made changes to the NYC site in the last week?
...
> Show me all configuration changes to the core router in the last month
```
